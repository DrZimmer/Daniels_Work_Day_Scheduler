# Daniels_Work_Day_Scheduler

## Work Day Scheduler Description

Some code was given for the creation of this scheduler.

- On opening, user is presented with a header that contains the title, a description, and the current date (using moment.js)
- In the main body, there are time slots split up using grid with the hour on the left, an editable text field in the middle, and a save button on the right.
- Each text area will be highlighted depending on the current time; gray for past, red for present hour, green for future.
- Upon clicking a text area, it will highlight and you can enter text.
- Upon clicking the adjacent save button, it will save whatever text is in the text area to local storage.
- Upon refreshing the page, the data in the text area will persist as long as it has been saved.
